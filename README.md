# Southampton-county-Record-Search
Project searches the public records of Southampton county, Virginia before 1900
It was based on the indexing work of the Brantley Association's Southampton project.
This will host the release version as well as code development.
At the moment, Marriage records and Minute records are still under development.

Several features that I want to add that are not complete, but I have started on are to add an advanced search option for users, UI (User Interface) improvements, multi threading which would reduce wait time and allow a graphic displaying a loading bar while loading.
